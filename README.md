# System Identification Project

Developed a MATLAB-based project to model and validate a second-order dynamic system using both parametric (ARMAX, OE) and frequency-domain methods. Conducted data acquisition, signal processing, Bode diagram analysis, and compared simulated and experimental responses. Emphasized the use of state-space models, transfer functions, and error evaluation to ensure accuracy.
